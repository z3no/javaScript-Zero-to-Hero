Sharpening my JavaScript skills that I acquired in the past 6 months.

I started looking into a course that I bought on Udemy at the beginning of 2022. It's called **"The Complete JavaScript Course 2022: From Zero to Expert!"**.
It has a lot of exercises and challenges. To refresh my brain and give an extra confidence boost I'm doing these. At the moment I do have to say it's going really good.
Not looking at the answers and figuring it out on my own. Feeling really happy about the exercises I've solved so far and it all clicks.

I will keep learning and challenging myself.
