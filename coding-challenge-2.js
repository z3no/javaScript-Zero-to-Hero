    Coding Challenge #2

    Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it.

    Your tasks:
    1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message is either
       "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
    2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.
       Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

    GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
